# POO - C++ Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the POO (Programming Object-Oriented) project in C++. This project aims to demonstrate the principles and implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It includes examples and exercises that cover the fundamental concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Features

- **Classes and Objects**: Basic creation and usage.
- **Encapsulation**: Using private, public, and protected access specifiers.
- **Inheritance**: Single and multiple inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Exception Handling**: Basic exception handling techniques.
